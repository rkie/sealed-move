# sealed-move
Play distance games, like chess, with time restrictions that only start when you open your opponents last move.

The concept arose because playing distance games removes the pressure that exists when playing at the same location. The need to make a decision within a certain amount of time adds to the experience. Also there can be some distrust if too much time is taken to respond - this is mitigated if the players don't open the move until they are ready to respond.

This will be a java based application using maven project structure. Spring MVC will create the pages and Spring/JPA or JDBC will be used to store state in a MySQL flavour database.
